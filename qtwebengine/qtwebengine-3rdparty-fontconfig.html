 fontconfig/src/ftglue.[ch]

 /* ftglue.c: Glue code for compiling the OpenType code from
  *           FreeType 1 using only the public API of FreeType 2
  *
  * By David Turner, The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org)
  *
  * This code is explicitely put in the public domain
  *
  * ==========================================================================
  *
  * the OpenType parser codes was originally written as an extension to
  * FreeType 1.x. As such, its source code was embedded within the library,
  * and used many internal FreeType functions to deal with memory and
  * stream i/o.
  *
  * When it was &amp;#x27;salvaged&amp;#x27; for Pango and Qt, the code was &amp;quot;ported&amp;quot; to FreeType 2,
  * which basically means that some macro tricks were performed in order to
  * directly access FT2 _internal_ functions.
  *
  * these functions were never part of FT2 public API, and _did_ change between
  * various releases. This created chaos for many users: when they upgraded the
  * FreeType library on their system, they couldn&amp;#x27;t run Gnome anymore since
  * Pango refused to link.
  *
  * Very fortunately, it&amp;#x27;s possible to completely avoid this problem because
  * the FT_StreamRec and FT_MemoryRec structure types, which describe how
  * memory and stream implementations interface with the rest of the font
  * library, have always been part of the public API, and never changed.
  *
  * What we do thus is re-implement, within the OpenType parser, the few
  * functions that depend on them. This only adds one or two kilobytes of
  * code, and ensures that the parser can work with _any_ version
  * of FreeType installed on your system. How sweet... !
  *
  * Note that we assume that Pango doesn&amp;#x27;t use any other internal functions
  * from FreeType. It used to in old versions, but this should no longer
  * be the case. (crossing my fingers).
  *
